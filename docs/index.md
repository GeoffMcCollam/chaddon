Chaddon is a browser extension that detects an active tabâ€™s url and connects you with other users currently browsing the same domain to a dynamic chatroom.

This project has been developed and maintained by [Michael Pierre](https://github.com/MPierre9), [Evan Davies](https://github.com/EmdaviesSeneca), [Geoff McCollam](https://github.com/GeoffMcCollam) and [Marco Beltempo](https://github.com/marcobeltempo)

Although Chaddon is still in its early stages, the team plans to have the extension publicly available in the Chrome Webstore by late April 2018.
